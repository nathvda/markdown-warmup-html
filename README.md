# markdown warmup-html

### Who am I 
I am a junior web developper who's learning about progressive enhancement.

### What is it
It is the modification of a webpage using HTML and CSS in order to style the page and give it a proper structure. I will convert Markdown to HTML and Css. I used a style.css file and also added a few colors using variables at the root of the page so I could reuse them through my css sheet when needed, and also change them when I feel like it. 

### When
This project was created on November 15th and 16th 2022, during the working hours.

### Contents 
Inside of it you will find a few html and css files. 

Since it is an exercise I have made during my formation at BeCode, it will be finished by the end of the allowed time, which is November 16th 2022.
